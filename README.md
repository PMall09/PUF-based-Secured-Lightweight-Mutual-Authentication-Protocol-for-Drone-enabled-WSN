# PUF-based-Secured-Lightweight-Mutual-Authentication-Protocol-for-Drone-enabled-WSN
The project aims to design a lightweight protocol to establish a secure connection between the devices and cloud via relocatable drone. 
The protocol utilizes the benefits of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to generate a common public key 
Each device used public to encrypt the message in communication to check security strength and overall performance of the protocol.
