# PUF-based-Secured-Lightweight-Mutual-Authentication-Protocol-for-Drone-enabled-WSN
The project aims to design a lightweight protocol to establish a secure connection among devices and the cloud via the relocatable drone. 
The protocol utilizes the benefits of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to generate a common public key for each device used to
encrypt the message in communication to check the security strength and the overall performance of the protocol.
